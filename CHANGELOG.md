# ChangeLog
##Â Version 3.0.1

Contains a couple of bug fixes on the Android side of the SDK:
- Fixes issue with `react-native` `< 0.63` resulting in app a crash on launch.

## Version 3.0.0
BREAKING CHANGE: New configuration requirements

The configuration has been updated and expects a `faceCenter` representing the expected center of the captured face.
This parameter is a percentage value (x, y). E.g.: (0,0) - top left; (0.5, 0.5) - center of the screen; (1,1) - bottom right; 

Please, check [README.md](https://github.com/getyoti/react-native-yoti-face-capture/blob/main/README.md) for more details.

## Version 2.0.1

Contains a couple of bug fixes on the iOS side of the SDK:
- Solves the discrepancy between the required screen units that needs to be used for Android and iOS. Now, both platforms will be expecting pixels when defining the scanning area.
- Fixes a crash when the component was used inside of a react-navigation react-stack screen.

## Version 2.0.0

BREAKING CHANGE: Low light detection

New configurable property `requireBrightEnvironment` has been added to the SDK entry point. If it is activated, the SDK will require a bright environment to take the selfie. To migrate from previous versions, it is needed to include this paremeter on the SDK setup.
Please, check [README.md](https://github.com/getyoti/react-native-yoti-face-capture/blob/main/README.md) for more details.
