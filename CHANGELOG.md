# ChangeLog
## Version 2.0.0

BREAKING CHANGE: Low light detection

New configurable property `requireBrightEnvironment` has been added to the SDK entry point. If it is activated, the SDK will require a bright environment to take the selfie. To migrate from previous versions, it is needed to include this paremeter on the SDK setup.
Please, check [README.md](https://github.com/getyoti/react-native-yoti-face-capture/blob/main/README.md) for more details.
